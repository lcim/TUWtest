### The case of Arondizuogu

The city of **Arondizuogu** in Ideato-North LGA of Imo State, Nigeria
was founded by Mazi Izuogu Mgbokpo, from Amankwu village in **Arochukwu**, Abia State, Nigeria.
It is surprising today that Arondizuogu is a very big city and cannot be 
compared with Amankwu in size. One may wonder how Arondizuogu grew so much in
size. This is explained by the ingenuity of Mazi Izuogu - he established and 
exploited the 'GREENCARD' scheme some centuries ago to a great success!
He welcomed all manner of people who were either displaced from their ancestral lands, slaves escaping from their masters, valiant men in search of conquest etc.
This provided him with a large population and consequently increased his economic and military might.
If Arondizuogu is made up of his direct descendants, it would have been a small
community today.
Being a conglomerate, there is a blend of culture.
Today Arondizuogu has 7 Autonomous communities:
1. Awa-izuogu
2. Ndiuche
3. Iheme-Izuogu
4. Ndiakeme
5. Ndiejezie
6. Aro-Umuduru
7. 
Today, so many countries are using this strategy, some in a modified way.
